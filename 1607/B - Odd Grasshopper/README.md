Making a jump from a point with coordinate $$$x$$$ with a distance $$$d$$$ to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate $$$x - d$$$, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate $$$x + d$$$.</p><p>The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer $$$i$$$ starting with $$$1$$$ the following holds: exactly $$$i$$$ minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly $$$i$$$. So, in the first minutes he jumps by $$$1$$$, then by $$$2$$$, and so on.</p><p>The direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an <span class="tex-font-style-bf">even</span> coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">left</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">otherwise</span> he jumps to the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">right</span>.</p><p>For example, if after $$$18$$$ consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate $$$7$$$, he will jump by a distance of $$$19$$$ to the right, since $$$7$$$ is an odd number, and will end up at a point $$$7 + 19 = 26$$$. Since $$$26$$$ is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of $$$20$$$, and it will move him to the point $$$26 - 20 = 6$$$.</p><p>Find exactly which point the grasshopper will be at after exactly $$$n$$$ jumps.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_0$$$ ($$$-10^{14} \leq x_0 \leq 10^{14}$$$) and $$$n$$$ ($$$0 \leq n \leq 10^{14}$$$) — the coordinate of the grasshopper's initial position and the number of jumps.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>Print exactly $$$t$$$ lines.
