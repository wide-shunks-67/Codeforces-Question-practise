It means that there is the only one bus with two axles in the bus fleet.</p><p>In the second test case it's easy to show that there is no suitable number of buses with $$$7$$$ wheels in total.</p><p>In the third test case the total number of wheels is $$$24$$$. The following options are possible:</p><ul> <li> Four buses with three axles. </li><li> Three buses with two axles and two buses with three axles. </li><li> Six buses with two axles. </li></ul><p>So the minimum number of buses is $$$4$$$ and the maximum number of buses is $$$6$$$.</p></div>
