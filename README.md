# Codeforces Question Practice

A collection of my Codeforces problem solutions, automatically pushed using [CFPusher](https://github.com/balajivis/CFPusher).

## 📖 About

This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces problems that I've solved as part of my competitive programming practice. Each problem solution is organized in separate directories by contest/problem number.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized with each folder representing a problem number from Codeforces: 
- Each folder contains the solution file(s) for that particular problem
- Solutions are primarily written in **C++**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Viewing Solutions

Browse through the directories to find solutions organized by problem number.  Each solution can be viewed directly on GitHub or cloned locally.

### Running Solutions Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wide-shunks-67/Codeforces-Question-practise.git

# Navigate to a specific problem directory
cd Codeforces-Question-practise/<problem-number>

# Compile and run (example for C++)
g++ -o solution solution.cpp
./solution
```

## 🔗 Resources
